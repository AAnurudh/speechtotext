# speechtotext
Description

This project is a speech-to-text application that converts spoken audio into text using advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The project supports various input formats, processes audio data, and outputs accurate transcriptions.

Features

- Support for multiple audio formats (e.g., WAV, MP3, MP4).

- High-accuracy transcription using deep learning models.

- Chunk-based processing for large audio files.

- Configurable settings for different languages and accents.

- Lightweight backend for seamless integration.

Technologies Used

- Python: Core language for development.

- Flask/Django: Backend framework.

- Torch: For deep learning models.

- SpeechRecognition: Audio processing.

- FFmpeg: Audio conversion and processing.

- Git LFS: For managing large audio and model files.

- React.js: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.

- Bootstrap: For responsive and styled web components.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/AAnurudh/speechtotext.git
```
Navigate to the Speechtotext
```
cd speechtotext
```
#### Backend setup

Set up a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv speechtotextvenv
```
```
source speechtotextvenv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install FFmpeg (required for audio processing):
Download FFmpeg from ```https://ffmpeg.org/ ```and add it to your system path.

Run the backend:
```
python app.py
```
#### Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:
```
cd frontend
```
Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Start the development server:
```
npm start
```
Access the application in your browser at ```http://localhost:3000```

#### Usage

1. Upload an audio file through the web interface or provide a file path via an API endpoint.

2. The application will process the audio and generate text output.

3. Access the transcribed text through the web interface or API.

#### Known Issues
1. Files exceeding 100 MB require Git LFS for upload and storage.

2. Large audio files may require additional memory and processing time.
